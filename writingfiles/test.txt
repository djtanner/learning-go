Make a save method on this struct to write a text-file with Title
as its name and Body as its content. Make a load function which,
given the title string, reads the corresponding text-file. Use *Page as an
argument because the structs could be quite large and we donâ€™t want to make
copies of them in memory. Use the ioutil functions to read and write from/to a file.
